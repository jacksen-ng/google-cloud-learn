## Product Overview: Jacksen-blog
---

### Project Summary
- This is a personal blog platform where I share my thoughts and experiences as a Data Science student living in Japan.
- The blog features posts in three languages: **English**, **Chinese**, and **Japanese**.
    - English posts focus on technical topics
    - Chinese posts explore cultural differences between Japan and Malaysia.
    - Japanese posts share my personal experiences and daily life in Japan

### Purpose & Goals
- In this blog project, I aim to learn how to build a website from scratch - covering everything from product overview, system architecture, CI/CD structure, development, to deployment. It's a hands-on journey through the **full-stack development process**.

- In the short-term, the blog will serve as a space to document my personal experiences and thoughts as a student.

- Through this development process, I also want to deepen my understanding of key concepts such as `MVP` and `Cloud Architecture`.

### Target Users
- In this blog, my target users are divided into three main groups based on language and interest:
    - English posts are intended for Malaysian or Japanese students who are interested in software development and technical content
    - Chinese posts are aimed at Malaysian Chinese readers who are curios about Japanese culture and everyday life.
    - Japanese posts target Japanese students who are interested in competitions, IT events, and my personal experiences in Japan.
