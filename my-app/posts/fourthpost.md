## What is Deep Learning?
---

- As we know deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers. It's one of the most powerful approaches in modern artificial intelligence. Okay this is quiet difficult to understand it.... For me, I will understand it by it's a very excellent model which is can help human to solve a lot of problem. 

- Traditional Machine Learning models use simple neural networks with one ro two computational layers, this kind of model can call it "Nondeep". Deep Learning models use three or more layers but typically hundreds or thousands of layers to train the models.
